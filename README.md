##  Data Preparation & Cleaning
Steps carried out:
1. **Imported** dataset into Excel  
2. **Transformed data** using Power Query  
3. **Cleaned missing values** (Debit/Credit)  
4. **Created Net Amount column** for transaction impact  
5. **Standardized categories** for consistency  
6. **Derived time features** (Month, Weekday) for trend analysis

##  Exploratory Data Analysis
- Comparison of **income vs. expenses**  
- Spending distribution by **categories & sub-categories**  
- **Trend analysis** across months and weekdays  
- Identification of **top recurring expenses**

##  Data Analysis & Market Insights

### 1.  Available Balance
- Tracked using cumulative **income minus expenses**  
- Positive balance = savings, Negative balance = overspending  

### 2. üè¶ Income Sources
- **Main source:** Salary  
- Minor inflows: **cash loans & miscellaneous income**  

### 3.  Spending Overview
- **Top Spending Categories**:
  - Living Expenses (Rent, Utilities)  
  - Dining Out (Coffee, Food)  
  - Transport  
- **Observation:** Small recurring expenses like coffee add up significantly  

### 4.  Monthly Trends
- Income spikes **at the start of each month** (salary inflows)  
- Expenses rise **towards month-end** (living costs & dining out)  

### 5.  Weekly Trends
- **Weekdays:** More income activity (salary)  
- **Weekends:** Higher discretionary spending (Dining, Transport, Leisure)
